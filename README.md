# purescript-webrow

Let's build a highly opinionated but fully-featured web framework in PureScript. For the backend. And the frontend.

<!--

## Goals

  [ ] Abstract web stuff away:

  [ ] But stay close to _nodejs_ in the lower layer to preserve "some" performance


## Goals

[ ] Provide effects for basic HTTP workflow (`Request`, `cookies`, `JWT signature` etc.)

[ ] Session effects and interpreter for different backends

[ ] Routing integration (with _routing-duplex_)

[ ] PostgreSQL handling with _selda_

[ ] Basic customizable applets for registration and auth

[ ] Form DSL

[ ] I18N and L10N opt-in

[ ] Example app:

  [ ] react-basic-mui rendering

  [ ] SSR + hydration

  [ ] Form rendering integration

  [ ] i18next integration
